# Exercise-3
In this exercise, you'll practice creating and merging branches. You should complete this exercise by creating your own repository to work with.

## Set up

To set up the repository, take the following steps:

- Create a new repository on GitHub with a `README.md` file.
- Clone the repository to your machine

## Making branches

In this section, you'll create a new branch, and practice switching between branches.

- Create a new branch called `new-feature`
- Checkout your new branch (you can do this in the same line as the last step, if you like)
- Edit your `README.md` file by adding a line (`line #2`) that says _Changes on `new-feature` branch_
- Then, `add` and `commit` you changes (note, this commit will only appear on your `new-feature` branch)


## Merging changes
In this section, you'll switch branches, make changes, then create a merge conflict when you attempt to merge in changes.

- Switch back to your master branch
- Edit your `README.md` file by adding a line (`line #2`) that says _Changes on `master` branch_
- Then, `add` and `commit` you changes (note, this commit will only appear on your `master` branch)
- Merge in changes from your `new-feature` branch (it should result in a merge conflict)
- Edit your `README.md` file to make it appear exactly as you want it (i.e., select changes from your desired branch)
- You'll then have to `add` your changes, and **make a new commit** to reflect your merge
- You can then push your changes (_all_ changes) back up to GitHub
